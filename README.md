## Introduction

The increase in popularity of live streaming of segmented
videos has given content providers the ability to offer multiple
representations of the same video. This study investigates the
relationship between the average frame quality as a metric and
gaming experiences by connecting a Neural Network model,
named NDNetGaming [6], to a DASH player. The primary
objective of this study was to assess frame quality across different gaming genres, and also evaluate different adaptive bitrate
algorithmsâ€™ performance when applied to video content with
various bitrate representations using that frame quality metric. The experiment encompassed a comprehensive analysis
under varying network conditions, including reduced throughput scenarios. The methodology of the experiment involved
integrating NDNetGaming with a JavaScript DASH player
to capture and measure the average frame qualities across
different gaming genres.
The evaluation includes assessing this frame quality metric
in Unrestricted Throughput and Slow 3G scenarios while applying different adaptive bitrate strategies to determine the
one with the least stalling and latency. The findings reveal
significant insights between frame quality and gaming experiences. Further, the study sheds light on the efficacy of
Dynamic, Throughput, Buffer-based (BOLA), L2A-LL and
LoL+ adaptive bitrate algorithms when subjected to varying
network conditions, with an aim to provide an enhanced user
experience.
This research contributes to the understanding of how the
frame quality effects gaming immersion to offer practical implications for optimizing video streaming applications to deliver high quality content, improving user satisfaction. From
the results of our evaluation, Dota2 displayed the most consistent frame quality, Rainbow Six Siege being a slower First
Person Shooter (FPS) also displayed consistency in frame
quality, Valorant showed a drop in frame quality in some sequences and FIFA had many fluctuations in average frame
quality.
